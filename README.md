# Facial_Expression_Recognition
This project is a special one. As the name says, it detects emotions / expressions of faces in an image and frames (video file and live cam)...

There are two parts to this project :
1) Creating a CNN using keras and then training the network Using the facial dataset, and saving the model obtained. There two ways to save the model... I tried two ways just to have a glimpse of how they both work.

2) Loading the trained model along with our pre-trained face-detector model to detect emotions on images and frames.

Note:
- The video folder contains an input video and two output videos obtained... one of the input video exceeded 60mb so had issue uploading it even with lfs (didn't think it was important to give too much time to this issue)
